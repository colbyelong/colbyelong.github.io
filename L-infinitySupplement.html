<p>
This page contains the supplementary materials referenced in the
paper "L-infinity optimization in tropical geometry and phylogenetics.‚Äù</p>
<p>We provide a Maple worksheet which generates the polyhedral subdivision of the space of dissimilarity maps on four elements referenced therein.
  The polyhedral subdivision is stored in a 37-element array called "Districts."
  Each entry of the array
  is a two-element list where the second entry is a set of trees and the first entry is a list of
  polyhedral cones comprising the district labeled by those trees. To execute these computations in Maple:</p>
<p>1) Check that you have a version of Maple that supports the package PolyhedralSets (available in Maple2015 and later versions)<br>
2) Download and unzip <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dibernst/Supplementary_materials/MapleSupplement_4LeafDistricts.mw.zip">this file</a><br>
3) Open the file MapleSupplement_4LeafDistricts.mw in Maple<br>
4) Evaluate the worksheet (this could take an hour or so)<br>
