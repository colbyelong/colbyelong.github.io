<p>This page contains the supplementary materials referenced in the paper &quot;Distinguishing Phylogenetic Networks.&quot;<br />

The Macaulay2 files below contain the computations to verify the claims 
made in

Proposition 4.4: <a href=NetworksSupplement/3LeafNetworks_AllModels.m2>3LeafNetworks_AllModels.m2</a>,

Proposition 4.6: <a href=NetworksSupplement/4LeafNetworks_JC.m2>4LeafNetworks_JC.m2</a>,

Proposition 4.7: <a href=NetworksSupplement/4LeafNetworks_CFN.m2>4LeafNetworks_CFN.m2</a>,
and

Lemma 4.13: <a href=NetworksSupplement/5LeafNetworks_JC.m2>5LeafNetworks_JC.m2</a>.

CORRECTIONS: There was a coding error in the file 3LeafNetworks_AllModels.m2 which
has been corrected. As a result, the statements concerning the 3-leaf, 3-cycle networks
in Proposition 4.4 and in Example 4.10 require slight modifications.


<ul>
<li>In Proposition 4.4, it is true that for the 3-leaf 3-cycle network 
there are no invariants for the CFN, JC, and K2P
models, however there is a single invariant for the K3P model which is independent
of the chosen labeling.</li>
<li>In Example 4.10, it is not true that the there are no invariants for the 3-leaf 3-cycle
with all leaf edges contracted. However, the example only requires that there are no
invariants for the 3-leaf 3-cycle with any one leaf edge contracted, which is true
and which is now verified in 3LeafNetworks_AllModels.m2.</li>
</ul>
