<p>This page contains the supplementary materials referenced in the paper &quot;The Effect of Gene Flow on Coalescent-based Species-tree Inference.&quot;<br />
  <br />

In the Maple worksheet
<a href=GeneFlowSupplement/GeneFlowSupplement_Maple.mw>GeneFlowSupplement_Maple.mw</a>
the formula for the concordant
triple frequency is derived, the formula is shown to agree
with the numerical computations from COALGF via an example, and
the limits referenced in the section "Analytic Results for the Isolation with Migration Model" are computed explicitly.
